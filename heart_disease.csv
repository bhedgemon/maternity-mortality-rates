"Age-adjusted rates per 100,000 U.S. standard population. Since death rates are affected by the population composition of a given area, age-adjusted death rates should be used for comparisons between areas because they control for differences in population composition."

"Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race, but are categorized as Hispanic; other groups are non-Hispanic. Race and Hispanic origin are reported separately on the death certificate in accordance with standards set forth by the Office of Management and Budget."
