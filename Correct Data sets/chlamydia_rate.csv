"Notes"
"Rates are per 100,000 population."

"Data collected in 2020 should be interpreted with caution due to uncertainty and difficulties brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. "

"Cases reported with unknown race/ethnicity are not included in this table."

"Trends in rates of reported cases of chlamydia are influenced by changes in incidence of infection, as well as changes in diagnostic, screening, and reporting practices. As chlamydial infections are usually asymptomatic, the number of infections identified and reported can increase as more people are screened even when incidence is flat or decreasing. Expanded use of more sensitive diagnostics tests (e.g., nucleic acid amplification tests) can also increase the number of infections identified and reported independent of increases in incidence. Additionally, increasing use of electronic laboratory reporting has likely increased the proportion of diagnosed cases that are reported. Consequently, an increasing chlamydia case rate may reflect increases in incidence of infection, screening coverage, and use of more sensitive tests, as well as more complete reporting.  Likewise, decreases in chlamydia case rates may suggest decreases in incidence of infection or screening coverage."
